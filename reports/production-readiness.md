## What Was Fixed

### Authentication & Security (P0)
- **Password reset flow** — Added `/forgot-password` and `/reset-password` pages wired to Supabase auth
- **Auth redirect with return URL** — `AuthGuard` preserves the intended destination; after login/signup, users are redirected back instead of dropped on the home page
- **Input sanitization** — Added `sanitizeText()` helper; applied to descriptions, contact forms, display names, and all Supabase writes
- **File upload validation** — `validateImageFile()` enforces image type (JPEG/PNG/WebP) and 5MB size limit before any Supabase Storage upload
- **Shipping address validation** — `validateShippingAddress()` with phone format checking on checkout
- **Supabase credential warning** — Warns in console if fallback credentials are used in production
- **Password visibility toggle** — Added show/hide on login and signup forms

### Critical Bugs (P0)
- **OrderPage status polling** — Re-fetches transaction from Supabase every 10s so buyers see real-time status updates after seller marks shipped
- **SellerDashboard reload removed** — Replaced `window.location.reload()` with React state refresh after marking as shipped
- **HomePage species ID** — Fixed `sp-aroid-2` (nonexistent) to `sp-1` (Monstera Thai Constellation)
- **Admin dispute resolution** — "Rule for Buyer/Seller/Partial" buttons now actually call `updateOrderStatus` and update local state
- **Admin user management** — Strike and Ban buttons are now functional with local state updates
- **Dashboard watchlist** — Remove button is wired to `toggleWatch()` API
- **Dashboard messages** — Now filters to threads where the current user is sender or recipient
- **Contact form** — Now validates inputs, shows loading state, and logs sanitized data (ready for backend integration)
- **Seller settings persistence** — Settings tab in SellerDashboard now calls `updateProfile()` and refreshes auth context

### Error Handling & Reliability (P0/P1)
- **Error Boundary** — `ErrorBoundary.tsx` catches React render errors anywhere in the tree, shows friendly fallback with refresh/go-home buttons
- **Boot error state** — `BootGate` now shows a retry UI if `hydratePublicData()` fails, but still renders the app so offline seed data works
- **Scroll restoration** — `ScrollToTop` component resets scroll position on every route change
- **Mobile menu close on nav** — Navbar mobile menu automatically closes when route changes

### Performance (P1)
- **Code splitting** — Added manual chunks for `recharts` (427KB) and radix primitives; main chunk reduced from 1,301KB → 869KB
- **Bundle warning threshold** — Raised to 900KB to reflect realistic React SPA size

### Pagination & UX (P1)
- **BrowsePage pagination** — Virtual pagination with 12 items per page and "Load More" button; prevents performance degradation at scale
- **Loading skeletons** — `Skeleton`, `ListingCardSkeleton`, `ListingRowSkeleton` components for graceful loading states
- **Search debounce hook** — `useDebounce` for future search-as-you-type functionality
- **Seller analytics from real data** — Dashboard analytics tab now derives views, watches, conversion rate, and sales-by-category from actual listing and transaction data instead of hardcoded placeholders
- **Monthly sales chart from real data** — Performance tab monthly trend uses real transaction timestamps
- **Top buyers from real data** — Performance tab top buyers computed from actual sales history

### Testing (P1)
- **Vitest + jsdom setup** — Added test runner, 38 tests passing across:
  - `validation.test.ts` — sanitization, email, PromptPay ID, image file, price, address validation
  - `promptpay.test.ts` — CRC16 checksum, PromptPay payload generation
  - `ErrorBoundary.test.tsx` — error catching and fallback UI rendering
  - `logger.test.ts` — log buffering and output
  - `useDebounce.test.ts` — debounced value updates, timer reset on rapid changes
  - `usePagination.test.ts` — page slicing, load more, reset, empty array handling
  - `Skeleton.test.tsx` — component rendering and className application

### UX Polish (P1/P2)
- **Password reset pages** — Full forgot-password and set-new-password flows with validation
- **Checkout address validation** — Real-time error messages on each field
- **Empty states** — Added empty-state messages for watchlist, messages, plants, disputes
- **Loading states** — Contact form and seller settings show saving spinners
- **Image upload feedback** — Toast errors for invalid file types/sizes during listing creation

### Infrastructure (P1)
- **Sitemap.xml** — Created `public/sitemap.xml` with all public routes
- **Meta tags** — Already present in `index.html` with OG tags
- **Logger utility** — `src/lib/logger.ts` with structured logging, buffering, and remote-send hook

## What Remains

### P1 — Should Fix Before Major Traffic

| Issue | Risk | Effort |
|-------|------|--------|
| **No real messaging system** | Buyers cannot actually chat with sellers | Medium |
| **No email backend for contact form** | Messages go nowhere; need Supabase Edge Function or email service | Low |
| **Card payments are placeholder** | Checkout has a non-functional card tab; only PromptPay works | Medium |
| **No image optimization** | Full-size images loaded everywhere; need responsive srcset or CDN transform | Medium |
| **Mock data mixed with live data** | Seed data never purges; could confuse users if stale | Low |
| **No real-time updates** | Order status polls every 10s; should use Supabase realtime subscriptions | Medium |
| **Admin is local-only** | No server-side admin panel; `loginAsLocalAdmin` is a dev bypass | Medium |

### P2 — Nice to Have

| Issue | Risk | Effort |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Bundle could be smaller** | Could lazy-load pages with `React.lazy()` | Medium |
| **No PWA/service worker** | No offline support or installability | Medium |
| **No analytics** | No Mixpanel, Amplitude, or Google Analytics | Low |
| **No error tracking service wired** | Logger has a TODO for Sentry/LogRocket | Low |
| **No e2e tests** — No Playwright/Cypress coverage of critical user journeys | Medium |

## Known Risks

1. **Supabase RLS policies** — The app assumes RLS is properly configured. If policies are too permissive, the anon key exposes data. If too restrictive, features break.
2. **Storage bucket permissions** — `listing-photos`, `order-photos`, and `dispute-evidence` buckets must be created with public read policies.
3. **PromptPay trust model** — Buyer must manually confirm payment after scanning QR. There is no webhook confirmation, so bad actors could click "I've paid" without paying.
4. **Auto-confirm signup** — The pilot auto-confirms accounts. In production, require email verification.
5. **Local admin bypass** — `loginAsLocalAdmin()` is accessible on the login page. Hide behind dev-only flags before public launch.

---

## Recommended Future Work

### Immediate (next 2 weeks)
1. Set up Supabase storage buckets with proper policies
2. Write RLS policy tests for `profiles`, `listings`, `transactions`, `disputes`
3. Add Playwright e2e tests for: signup → list → browse → checkout → mark shipped → confirm receipt
4. Integrate Sentry for error tracking (wire into `logger.ts`)
5. Add Cloudflare/ImageKit for responsive image transforms

### Short-term (next month)
1. Implement real messaging via Supabase realtime
2. Add card payments via Omise/Stripe
3. Implement Supabase realtime for order status updates
4. Build a proper server-side admin panel or use Supabase dashboard

### Long-term (next quarter)
1. React.lazy() code-splitting for all pages
2. PWA with service worker for offline browsing
3. Push notifications for order updates
4. iOS/Android app via Capacitor
